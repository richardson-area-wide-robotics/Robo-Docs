# Robo Docs

Welcome to **Robo Docs**, the technical documentation for the Richardson Area Wide Robotics (RAWR)'s code.

This site explains **how the code should be organized**, **how each system works**,  
and **how developers should navigate, modify, and extend the robot software**.  
If you're new to the codebase or contributing for the first time, start here.
